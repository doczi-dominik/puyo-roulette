## Chaining Forms

You can easily add chaining forms:

1. Get a 512x512 image to be used on the cards and put it in `imgs/`. Preferably, the image should be:
    - Using classic Puyo skin
    - Background replaced with transparency
    - Only show a 4x4 Puyo area of the board
2. Put an entry in the `forms` array in `forms.js`. Use the other entries as examples.
3. Done! The rest will be handled by JS.

## Code

Since web development is not my strong suit and this project was hacked together in a day, the source is likely suboptimal. Every contribution is welcome; I'll continue to refactor it to the best of my ability.
